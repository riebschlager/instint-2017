# INSTINT 2017
### Links, resources and notes.

I don't know about you, but I'm a horrible note taker. But maybe, collectively, we might add up to one amazing note taker. I'll be adding my own notes and thoughts to this repo during the event. Feel free to fork and add your own. Want to share with the rest of the class? Send me a pull request.
