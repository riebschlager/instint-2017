# Creating Interactions with Machine Learning - Dr. Rebecca Fiebrink

- Goldsmiths, University of London
- How do we support people's existing creative practice?
- How do we expand people's creative capabilities?
- Three steps to a sensor-based installation: Sense, Interpret, Produce Response
- Interpretation is the difficult and annoying step.
- Build new interactions from examples of human action and computer response.
- Use supervised learning to infer relationships between human movement and appropriate sound/animation/etc.
- Open Sound Control
- The Wekinator
- Anne Hege - _From the Waters_
- Laetitia Sonami, Spring Spyre, NIME Keynote 2014
- Machine learning can support the design and creation process
- Rapid prototyping, hands-on evaluation, iterative refinement
- Machine learning has benefits over coding
- Machine learning can take advantage of embodied expertise and practices
- Gesture and sound, not math and code
- Machine learning can offer easy access to complexity, surprise and discovery
- High-dimensional continuous mappings are often better than buttons and triggers
- Serendipity is hard with complex code
- Programming expertise should not be a pre-requisite for creating new interactions
